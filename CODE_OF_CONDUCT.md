# CODE OF CONDUCT

As members of the Kitawi community, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We value the participation of each member of the Kitawi community and want everyone to feel welcome and respected. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in any Kitawi-related activities, including talks, presentations, or social events.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or nationality.
- Sexual images in public spaces.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
- Inappropriate physical contact.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

Kitawi community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the Kitawi project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Kitawi project maintainers at [kitawi.dev@gmail.com](mailto:kitawi.dev@gmail.com). We will respond as promptly as we can.

We expect everyone in the Kitawi community to follow these guidelines at all times when participating in the project or its community.
